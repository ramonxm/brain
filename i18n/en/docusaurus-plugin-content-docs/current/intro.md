# Introdução

I’m a seasoned full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience, specializing in React, React Native, and Node.js.

During my career, I worked at Globo — the largest television company in Latin America — where I helped develop web and mobile applications that support the entire production workflow of soap operas, series, and films. I used technologies like AWS, GCP, Node.js, React, React Native, GraphQL, among others.

I’m also active in the tech community and content creation. I teach web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React) at Estartando Devs, a non-profit initiative that provides access to tech education for people from low-income backgrounds.

I'm passionate about building scalable, high-performance applications that make a real impact. I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy driving projects from concept to launch.
