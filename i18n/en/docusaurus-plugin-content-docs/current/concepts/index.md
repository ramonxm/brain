# 💡 Fundamental Concepts

Welcome to the fundamental concepts section! Here you'll learn about the core principles that underlie computer science and programming.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers the essential concepts that every programmer and computer scientist should understand:

### 🎯 Core Fundamentals
- **Big O Notation**: Understanding algorithm complexity and performance analysis
- **Memory Management**: How computers handle memory allocation (Stack vs Heap)
- **Time and Space Complexity**: Analyzing the efficiency of algorithms

### 🔄 Programming Mechanisms
- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Understanding queue-like behavior
- **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**: Understanding stack-like behavior
- **Swap Operations**: Fundamental data manipulation techniques

### ⚡ Concurrency & Parallelism
- **Threads**: Understanding concurrent execution
- **Processes**: System-level program execution
- **Synchronization**: Coordinating concurrent operations

### 🏗️ System Architecture
- **Computer Architecture**: How computers are built and operate
- **Memory Management**: Advanced memory handling concepts
- **Operating Systems**: How systems manage resources

## Getting Started

Start with **Big O Notation** to understand how we measure algorithm efficiency, then explore memory concepts to understand how computers store and retrieve data.

Each concept builds upon the previous ones, so we recommend following the suggested order for the best learning experience.
